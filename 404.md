# 404 Error - Oops, you caught us!

## This website was a stolen repository.

Turns out, we're not as original as we thought. The page you're looking for is as missing as our sense of shame.

### Looking for the real deal? 

Check out the **actual** site:

[https://christopher-kt.github.io/html5-homework/](https://christopher-kt.github.io/html5-homework/)

Because nothing beats the original, except maybe our attempt at humor.
